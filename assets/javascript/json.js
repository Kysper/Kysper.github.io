        description: `I grew up in a small town in West Virginia, I was fascinated by computers growing up, and
        I knew I wanted to work with technology at a young age.
        After graduating high school, I enjoyed reparing, building and maintaining computers for friends and family.
        I met my wonderful wife soon after and moved to Missouri to be with her.
        I spend my recent years working for a mirror and glass company cutting and fabricating mirrors for customers.
        Everything changed when we welcomed our first child into the world this year.
        After our baby girl's birth, I wanted to teach her to follow her dreams fearlessly and persistently.
        In an attempt to show her this, I quit my job of eight years and enrolled in KU Coding Certificate in pursuit of my passions.`,
